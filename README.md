# Concurrent-Programming-in-Java
An introductory course of  Concurrent Programming in Java by Rice university in Coursera 
 
Where I've learnt the follwing skills:
•	Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
•	Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java
•	Atomic variables and isolation
•	Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)
•	Actor model in Java

This repository contains 4 mini-project with above mentioned technology, where
1. The First mini project implements __ReciprocalArraySum using RecursiveAction's in Java's Fork/Join Framework (Demo)__
2. The Second mini project implements __Analysing Student Statictis Using Java Parallel Stream__
3. The Thrid mini project implements  __Parallelizing Matrix-Matrix Multiply Using Loop Parallelism__
4. The Fourth mini project implements __Using Phasers to Optimize Data-Parallel Applications__
