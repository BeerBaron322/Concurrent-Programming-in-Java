# Concurrent-Programming-in-Java

## _This is the second course in [Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java Specialization by Rice University in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp)_


An introductory course of  Concurrent Programming in Java by Rice university in Coursera 
Where I've learnt the follwing skills:
1.	Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
2. Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java
3.	Atomic variables and isolation
4.	Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)
5.	Actor model in Java

This repository contains 4 mini-project with above mentioned technology, where
1. The First mini project exhibits __Locking and Synchronization__
2. The Second mini project exhibits __Global and Object-Based Isolation__
3. The Thrid mini project exhibits  __Sieve of Eratosthenes Using Actor Parallelism__
4. The Fourth mini project exhibits __Parallelization of Boruvka's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm__
